# Datastore-Mock
Datastore mock i created for austiblox. i guess
## UPDATE 23/5/23 I managed to do this for multiple games so you can let other people use your datastore server for their games. ez and you are welcome
## Warning! This is for personal use only(by that i mean no other game can connect to your python script unless you host another one with a different port)

## How to use:
1. Start the python script(make sure to install em flask package)
2. Make sure you got the right domain? i am using a nginx proxy so i can use port 443 if i want to while proxying it to localhost.
3. then use the lua script in game????
4. Voila???

## Examples:
 ```
